## Development

### Setup the project

You'll definitely want to install [`plis`](https://github.com/IcaliaLabs/plis), as in this case will
let you bring up the containers needed for development. This is done by running the command
`plis start`, which will start up the services in the `development` group (i.e. rails
and sidekiq), along with their dependencies (posgres, redis, etc).

Alternatively, you can use the more verbose `docker-compose` like you usually would. Both
methods of starting containers will be shown, but keep in mind out of
every plis/docker-compose pair of commands you only need to choose one.

After installing please you can follow this simple steps:

1. Clone this repository into your local machine

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:IcaliaLabs/advanced_testing_techniques.git

```
2. Copy the `example.env` file to `.env` in the project's source directory.

```bash
$ cd advanced_testing_techniques
$ cp example.env .env
```

The container can be started with both of these files being empty, but they must exist.
Talk to any team member to get the contents of each file so the
application works correctly.

3. Run the web service in bash mode to get inside the container by using
   the following command:

plis:

```bash
$ plis run web bash
```

docker-compose:

```bash
$ docker-compose run web bash
```

4. Inside the container you need to migrate the database:

```
% rails db:migrate
```

### Running the stack for Development

1. Fire up a terminal and run:

plis:

```bash
$ plis start
```

docker-compose:

```bash
$ docker-compose up
```

That command will lift every service advanced_testing_techniques needs, such as the `rails server`, `postgres`, and `redis`.


It may take a while before you see anything, you can follow the logs of the containers with:

```
$ docker-compose logs
```

Once you see an output like this:

```
web_1   | => Booting Puma
web_1   | => Rails 5.1.3 application starting in development on http://0.0.0.0:3000
web_1   | => Run `rails server -h` for more startup options
web_1   | => Ctrl-C to shutdown server
web_1   | Listening on 0.0.0.0:3000, CTRL+C to stop
```

This means the project is up and running.

### Stop the project

In order to stop advanced_testing_techniques as a whole you can run:

```
% plis stop
```

This will stop every container, but if you need to stop one in particular, you can specify it like:

```
% plis stop web
```

`web` is the service name located on the `docker-compose.yml` file, there you can see the services name and stop each of them if you need to.

### Restoring the database

You probably won't be working with a blank database, so once you are able to run advanced_testing_techniques you can restore the database, to do it, first stop all services:

```
% plis stop
```

Then just lift up the `db` service:

```
% plis start db
```

The next step is to login to the database container:

```
% docker exec -ti advanced_testing_techniques_db_1 bash
```

This will open up a bash session in to the database container.

Up to this point we just need to download a database dump and copy under `advanced_testing_techniques/backups/`, this directory is mounted on the container, so you will be able to restore it with:

```
root@a3f695b39869:/# bin/restoredb advanced_testing_techniques_dev db/backups/<databaseDump>
```

If you want to see how this script works, you can find it under `bin/restoredb`

Once the script finishes its execution you can just exit the session from the container and lift the other services:

```
% plis start
```

### Debugging

We know you love to use `debugger`, and who doesn't, and with Docker is a bit tricky, but don't worry, we have you covered.

Just run this line at the terminal and you can start debugging like a pro:

```
% plis attach web
```

This will display the logs from the rails app, as well as give you access to stop the execution on the debugging point as you would expect.

**Take note that if you kill this process you will kill the web service, and you will probably need to lift it up again.**

### Running specs

To run specs, you can do:

```
$ plis run test rspec
```

Or for a specific file:

```
$ plis run test rspec spec/models/user_spec.rb
```

### Analyzing code for issues

We use codeclimate to analyze code & detect issues. Install [Codeclimate CLI](https://github.com/codeclimate/codeclimate#packages)
and then run the following commands:

```bash
1: Fetch the codeclimate engine configurations - we continuously update them,
so it is a good idea to run this command often:
codeclimate prepare

2: You might not have the codeclimate engines downloaded. While this is not
required, doing this miht prevent you from thinking codeclimate is stuck on
the `structure` and `duplication` checks, when in fact they are huge images :(
codeclimate engine:install

3: Finally, run codeclimate to analyze the code:
codeclimate analyze
```
