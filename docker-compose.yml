  # Where are the rest of the app services? (i.e. test, worker, web, etc)
  #
  # We've separated the app services from the rest of the services to streamline
  # the CI/CD pipeline execution. You'll find the app service definitions on the
  # `docker-compose.override.yml` file.
  #
  # You don't have to do anything special to docker-compose or plis to make the
  # project work as usual. By default, `docker-compose` will read
  # `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-compose.override.yml` files, merging their
  # contents before doing any actual work.
  #
  # See https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends/#understanding-multiple-compose-files
